## Featured: Automation is not the enemy

"But the statement “automated testing won’t solve web accessibility” is, frankly, absurd. On one hand, it is almost too obvious to bother saying. But on the other hand, it is absurd because it implies that automated testing is bad and should not be used. I would argue that the opposite is true: it is already good and we’d better hope that automated testing gets better and its use more prolific."

Eli Mellen relays an approach for [accessibility and the product person](https://eli.li/2023/02/16/accessibility-and-the-product-person) to make it happen. I like how Eli emphasizes focusing on people and processes. In my experience, that's how the majority of accessibility work happens.
