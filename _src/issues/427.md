## New to A11y

Ashley Peacock created a [Certificate of Professionals in Accessibility Core Competencies Quiz App](https://a11yconsultant.com) that you might find helpful if you're studying for the certification. Keep in mind that it's not an official resource, and you don't need a certification to understand accessibility, but it could be a good way for you to get some reps in when learning.
