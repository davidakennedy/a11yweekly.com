Marina Castejon walks you through some of the [basics of accessibility](https://ubuntu.com/blog/accessible-by-design-how-we-are-designing-for-accessibility-at-canonical), and how the Canonical staff is thinking about the topics and tackling the tasks ahead. I like how Marina and company have choosen to fall back to the principle of comparable experience when WCAG alone doesn't cut it.
