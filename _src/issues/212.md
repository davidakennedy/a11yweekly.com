Shona Louise expresses how [tiring it can be to constantly fight for your rights as a disabled person](http://www.shonalouise.com/2020/10/im-tired-of-fighting-for-my-rights-as.html#.X59OAC9h3MI). To quote Shona, "Human rights issues are the responsibility of every human to solve, and whilst this is an issue across the board it really feels like disability has been heavily left behind." Those in accessibility need to do the work of making progress happen, and shouldn't always rely on disabled people for pointers.
