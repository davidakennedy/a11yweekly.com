## Featured: Focus priming

"What’s it called when you click somewhere on a webpage? Most people either won’t care, either because it doesn’t seem to do anything, or they can’t click because they don’t use a mouse or trackpad. But I care because I use it when testing the accessibility of web pages. If I click somewhere and then press ⇥ (Tab), keyboard focus is placed on the next interactive element (link, form field, etc.) after where I clicked."

Dennis Deacon has a short post with [ideas for Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)](https://www.dennisdeacon.com/web/accessibility/global-accessibility-awareness-day-gaad-ideas/). It's short notice (May 15), but you could pull off some of the ideas without massive effort. Of course, you don't need a special day to do any of these activities.
