## Featured: Accessible Accordions

If you ever wondered how to approach an accordian in an accessible way, this is your week. Scott O'Hara and Heydon Pickering both have tutorials on building one that will make your job easier and teach you a thing or two.

Read [Collapsible sections](https://inclusive-components.design/collapsible-sections/) and [Accessible ARIA accordions](http://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/10/25/accordion-release.html).

## New to A11y

Mandy Michael ask an important question: [Is there any value in people who cannot write JavaScript](https://medium.com/@mandy.michael/is-there-any-value-in-people-who-cannot-write-javascript-d0a66b16de06)? The answer, of course, is yes, but people often forget the value that comes with really knowing HTML and CSS. It's a good reminder if you're new to accessibility since so much groundwork begins with the basics.
