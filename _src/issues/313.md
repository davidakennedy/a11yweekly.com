## Featured: A first look at the Websites and Software Applications Accessibility Act Bill

"This week, Sen. Tammy Duckworth and Rep. John Sarbanes introduced a digital accessibility bill called the Websites and Software Applications Accessibility Act (or the #A11yAct, if you're on Twitter) to Congress. If passed, it would build on the Americans with Disabilities Act, and lead to clearer regulations for digital accessibility requirements in the US."

## New to A11y?

Content Design London has an excellent wiki about [readability and content](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk) that you might find helpful. I especially like the [plan language section](https://readabilityguidelines.co.uk/clear-language/plain-english/). Plus, I admire the overall scope of the project, "a collaboratively developed, universal content style guide, based on usability evidence."
