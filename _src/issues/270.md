## New to A11y?

I imagine for some of you, reading through W3C specification documentation on various accessibility topics can be overwhelming. But they come packed with great information. [ARIA in HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/2021/REC-html-aria-20211209/) landed this week as a W3C recommendation. It's full of advice and best practices for using ARIA in everyday situations.
