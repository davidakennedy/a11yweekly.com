## New to A11y

Lots of resources exist for learning different screen readers. But I always like new takes, and Martin Underhill has a [getting started with NVDA](https://www.tempertemper.net/blog/getting-started-with-nvda) guide, which you might find useful. I appreciate how Martin has tips for configuring NVDA, which isn't often covered elsewhere.
