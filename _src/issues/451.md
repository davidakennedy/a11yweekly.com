## New to A11y

I cover writing alternative text well a lot in this space because its often overlooked or harder than people think. Michael Beck writes about [how to write alt text for complex images](https://afixt.com/how-to-write-alt-text-for-complex-images-a-guide-to-clarity-and-accessibility/).
