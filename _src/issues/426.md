## Featured: Don’t use aria-label on static text elements

Warning: This link has some language not safe for work. However, its message is sound, reminding you to [don't mess with scrolling](https://dontfuckwithscroll.com) on websites and applications. The site compiles 10 excellent reasons not to do so, including a huge violation of the user experience. I appreciate how it closes: "Don't make scrolling a thing. Just let people scroll."
