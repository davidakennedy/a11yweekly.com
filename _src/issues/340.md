Disability blogger Holly, of Life of a Blind Girl, [wrote a post about supporting disabled collogues](https://lifeofablindgirl.com/2022/12/04/how-to-support-your-disabled-colleagues/) that's full of practical advice. Holly makes the point about not assuming what people with disabilities can and can’t do. It's easy to do in an ableist world.
