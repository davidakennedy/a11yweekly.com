I have a soft spot for the WAVE accessibility extension. Why? Because it's one of the first accessibility tools I used extensively when I went deep into this field. It's nice to see that friends of WAVE, Pope Tech [wrote about how to use the WAVE extension](https://blog.pope.tech/2022/12/02/wave-accessibility-testing/) for accessibility testing. It's thorough and includes a video too.
