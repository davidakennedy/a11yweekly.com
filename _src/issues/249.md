## New to A11y?

I read this piece by Seth Godin the other day about how [good writing is cheaper than special effects](https://seths.blog/2021/07/good-writing-is-cheaper-than-special-effects/), and it got me thinking. You could draw a parallel from that to accessibility. How? Inclusive design is cheaper than remediation. Many organizations pour money into accessibility testing late in the product lifecycle when that money may have a better return if invested in accessibility earlier during the design phase. As Seth says, "... it might be worth more to take the time and invest the effort to design something great instead."
