## New to A11y

Geri Reid shares the advice: [Don't leave the screen reader hungry](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2025/17/). What does that mean? As Geri says: "Screen readers don’t always announce what’s visually on screen. This article explores that gap - through the medium of burritos." People newer to accessibility often overindex on what gets announced by readers while also missing vital things it won't announce because of a design flaw in an interface. This article helps with that.
