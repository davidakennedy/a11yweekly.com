Erik Kroes shares the advice: [Don't start testing accessibility with a screen reader](https://www.erikkroes.nl/blog/dont-test-accessibility-with-a-screen-reader/). Erik recommends the keyboard to start, and I agree. Using this tool, you can catch a lot of issues and potential trouble spots without the complexity of learning a screen reader, especially if you're not a native screen reader user.
