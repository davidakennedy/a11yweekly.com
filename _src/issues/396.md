Ashlee M. Boyer has a cool resource for you if you're looking to learn more about accessibility on Global Accessibility Awareness Day and beyond: [a totally free, 16-day email course to level up](https://www.semanticfish.com/gaad-2024). It looks like one lesson per day, and delivered in bite-sized chunks. Love the concept.
