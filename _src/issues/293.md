## New to A11y?

Andrew Walpole says [accessibility is hard and important](https://andrewwalpole.com/blog/accessibility-is-hard-and-important/). It's easy to feel a spectrum of shame and despondency as you dive in, but push past it. I like how Andrew emphasizes both learning new things and unlearning bad habits. You have to do both.
