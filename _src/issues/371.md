## Featured: Accessibility annotation kits only annotate

"An uncomfortable truth is that the vast majority of access-related issues are created in the design phase.

Accessibility annotation kits help tackle this problem, and in doing so lower the downstream issues that would be created without their presence. This is to say that I really like the idea behind them.

Liking an idea does not mean the idea is exempt from criticism. This post is long, but I feel its length is necessary to unpack some of the issues intrinsic with performing accessibility annotations."

Amy Hupe created a podcast called the [Systems of Harm podcast](https://systems-of-harm.fireside.fm) that you should check out. In it, Amy interviews others in the field about their experiences of design systems, systemic exclusion, and how they can work to design more inclusive experiences. I can't wait to go deep on this podcast, especially since design systems impact accessibility in a big way.
