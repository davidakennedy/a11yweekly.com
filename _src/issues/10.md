## Managing focus

In today's world of complex web apps full of toggles, modals, accordions and other custom design patterns, many developers forget to manage focus. What does that mean exactly?

Let's use a modal window as an example – something we all encounter every day on the web. Our example has an email subscription form in it. Once that modal is triggered, we should shift focus programmatically with JavaScript either to the div containing the modal or the email form input itself. Some of this depends on the content in that modal. Once the user closes the modal, we should shift focus back to where they were before they opened the modal. The principles remain the same in most cases where a user's visual focus needs to shift to a new element on the page. You'll want to shift the focus for other users as well.

For further reading on the ins and outs of managing focus, check out Heydon Pickering's [Learning to Focus](http://www.sitepoint.com/learning-to-focus/). Also, see his [practical ARIA examples](http://heydonworks.com/practical_aria_examples/), many of which have code that demonstrates managing focus.
