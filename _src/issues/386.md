## New to A11y

The annual free, virtual axe-con accessibility conference happened a few weeks ago. If you missed it, you can still catch all the talks. [Check out the conference schedule](https://www.deque.com/axe-con/schedule/), and create an account on the site, which allows you to view talks on demand. I'm still working my way through the list, and hope to have some favorites in the future.
