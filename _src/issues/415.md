## Featured: Accessibility preference settings, information architecture, and internalized ableism

"The talk deliberately avoids mentioning VoiceOver, or screen readers in general. There is a reason behind this omission, and that reason is internalized ableism. People don't think of themselves as disabled, so they don't think the accessibility preference area applies to them."

## Sponsored: Opinion - Accessible websites are a pathway to DEI

Digital accessibility amplifies diversity by first recognizing and then respecting the unique abilities and needs of a diverse range of users. By designing platforms and content for a wide range of visitors and their abilities, we develop wider site visitorship.

## New to A11y

I remember when I first read about VPATs. It was a confusing world of acronyms that led to needing to learn WCAG more deeply. More acronyms! WebAIM has an article on [making VPATs and ACRs more effective in procurement](https://webaim.org/articles/procurement/vpat/) that may help you if you new to this like I once was. WebAIM offers solid, clear advice around how to approach a VPAT that I didn't have, but needed.
