## New to A11y

Schalk Neethling write about [why I care deeply about web accessibility and you should too](https://dev.to/schalkneethling/why-i-care-deeply-about-web-accessibility-and-you-should-too-274a). Lots of folks connect to web accessibility for different reasons, as well they should. I like how this story shares some of the ways that may be less common.
