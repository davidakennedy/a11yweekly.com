## Featured: forced-color-adjust: none is an unavoidable foot gun

"This post is aimed at anyone working in an environment with multiple other developers or development teams while needing to maintain a codebase over time. If: you lovingly handcraft all your styles, and everyone who contributes is familiar with all CSS in the codebase, and this stays true both now and in perpetuity, then this probably won't be a problem. However if you, like me, work in a large and chaotic system where code you write is copied, consumed, customized, and maintained away from your control by many other people, then it is a matter of when and not if a forced-color-adjust: none style will cause high contrast mode bugs."
