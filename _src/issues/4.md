## What Can I Do Now for Better Accessibility?

_I'm on the road this week, so I'm sharing a tip previously published on my blog, called, What Can I Do Now for Better Accessibility?_

**If I could do a few basic things in my projects right now, what should they be?** Start simple. Focus on ensuring users can navigate your site using the keyboard. Make sure you have `:focus` styles where appropriate, and that each style has a reasonable contrast.

Next, make sure each control follows web standards. What do I mean by that? Items that behave like links, buttons and form fields should be just that: `<a>`, `<button>` or `<input>`. Don't make your own interface elements from scratch. Use native elements, which come with accessibility features built in, and enhance from there.

Lastly, provide a `<label>` element for each form field in your code. Labels allow screen reader users to know what a field is meant to do or what that field needs in order to move on in an interface. Don't make it harder.
