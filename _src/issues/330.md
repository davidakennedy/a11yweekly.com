## Featured: Modern Health, frameworks, performance, and harm

"A person seeking help in a time of crisis does not care about TypeScript, tree shaking, hot module replacement, A/B tests, burndown charts, NPS, OKRs, KPIs, or other startup jargon. Developer experience does not count for shit if the person using the thing they built can’t actually get what they need."

## New to A11y

I'm not sure how new it is, but I hadn't seen this great WebAIM article on [creating a community that values accessibility](https://webaim.org/articles/communities/creating) until recently. It covers a lot of topics that get to the center of establishing not just a community, but a culture around accessibility. That kind of work is vital to making progress in creating better, more inclusive products and sites.
