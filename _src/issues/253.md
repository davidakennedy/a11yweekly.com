You may take HTML for granted. But it's powerful. You can learn just how powerful through two links this week. The first from Crystal Preston-Watson: A video all about [semantic HTML and accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSNUi7pRmWg). Follow that up with a short post from Rian Rietveld on ARIA called, [The first rule for using ARIA](https://www.a11y-collective.com/blog/the-first-rule-for-using-aria/).
