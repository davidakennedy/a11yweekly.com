## Featured: Visually hidden content is a hack that needs to be resolved, not enshrined

"But, as I’ve hopefully illustrated by now, while there is a common ruleset for visually hiding content, codifying that to me seems more of a silent acknowledgement that a hack is the best we can do. I don’t agree. The web should be better than that."
