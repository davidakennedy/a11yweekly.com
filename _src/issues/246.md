Mark Steadman muses on [JavaScript frameworks and the lost art of HTML](https://www.deque.com/blog/javascript-frameworks-the-lost-art-of-html/), saying "We are in the midst of a very large problem in the web development field, where HTML is being left in the rearview mirror in place of JavaScript.".
