Have you heard of the [Accessibility Internet Rally (AIR)](https://knowbility.org/programs/air)? It's an annual accessibility web building contest. According to the site, "Teams of web pros learn about accessibility and use their new skills to compete for top honors by creating a site for a local charity. This fun, friendly competition builds community around the powerful idea of equal access to the web for all." A small nonprofit, Knowbility, runs the event, and it's a great way to learn about accessibility and help create a real website that makes a difference to a charity. Check it out if you're looking to dive deeper into this field.
