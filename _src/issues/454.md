## Featured: WCAG 3, increment or overhaul?

Ashley Willis has advice and potent messages about how [feedback is not an attack](https://ashley.dev/posts/feedback-is-not-an-attack/). While this isn't a post about accessibility specifically, longtime readers will know I like to throw in a few of those. Accessibility work happens in the feedback given. The main message here should resonate: "Feedback should be thoughtful, specific, grounded, and mutual. If you’re not doing it with intention, you’re not doing it right."
