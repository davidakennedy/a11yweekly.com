[10k Apart](https://a-k-apart.com): From the contest site, sponsored by Microsoft and An Event Apart, "With so much of an emphasis on front-end frameworks and JavaScript runtimes, it’s time to get back to basics—back to optimizing every little byte like your life depends on it and ensuring your site can work, no matter what. The Challenge? Build a compelling web experience that can be delivered in 10kB and works without JavaScript."
