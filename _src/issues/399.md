## Featured: The impact of recent U.S. Federal rulemaking on web and digital accessibility

"Recently, we have seen significant movement in Federal policy on web and digital accessibility. Specifically, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which is enforced by the Department of Justice, and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as implemented by the Federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), now include specific accessibility requirements for websites, mobile apps, and kiosks (more on kiosks later). They both include specific standards, implementation timelines, and some notable exceptions. These two updates represent a huge step forward in protecting the civil rights of individuals who require digital accessibility."
