Stephanie Hill has gathered some useful resources when it comes to [designing for accessibility as part of comms planning](https://gcs.civilservice.gov.uk/blog/designing-for-accessibility-as-part-of-comms-planning/) you might find helpful. Often, when we think of accessibility, we go into the technical parts of the topic. That's why I like the two links that cover video transscripts and web content here. Those every day things help make a more accessible web much faster than whether you're approaching ARIA in the right way.
