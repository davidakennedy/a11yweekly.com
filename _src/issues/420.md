## Featured: The Accessibility Operations Guidebook is out

"The accessibility field has a burnout problem. People get into this work to make accessible products and services. But, they often find themselves doing a lot of other work—program management, legal compliance, and constant, constant advocacy—instead. This isn't usually what people sign up for, and it leads directly to burnout. This book seeks to help break that cycle. It's not about accessibility work itself, but about building digital accessibility programs that are more sustainable, intersectional, and data-driven."

## New to A11y

Demelza Feltham covers how to handle [form validation and error messages](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2024/10/21/foundations-form-validation-and-error-messages/) in another foundations post from Tetralogical. This is timely for me as I'm working to improve error messages in a project. The pragmatic advice of combining inline and post-submission validation is gold.
