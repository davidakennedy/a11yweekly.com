Mariel de la Garza offers an [introduction to web accessibility for businesses and consultants](https://www.viget.com/articles/web-accessibility-an-overview-for-businesses-and-consultants/) that touches on all the basics. I like how Mariel separates some of the true benefits of accessibility with why you must care–it's the law in most places.
