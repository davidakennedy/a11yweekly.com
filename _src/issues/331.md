## Featured: Why I'm not the biggest fan of Single Page Applications

"With this post I’m not trying to convince anyone to build their websites differently, I just want to share my view and my experiences as someone who has been building websites for over 20 years, and I try to summarize reasons why some developers, including me, are wary of building SPAs."

## New to A11y

You may have heard of Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD). It's an annual event every May to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital access and inclusion. But you probably haven't heard of the [GAAD Speakers Fund](https://gaad.foundation/speakersfund/). Each year, the GAAD Foundation will award one or more individuals with up-to $3,000 USD to cover expenses associated with speaking about an aspect of digital accessibility at an in-person event. The fund just launched in December, so it's a great time to apply if you're thinking about giving your first or another talk about accessibility at an event.
