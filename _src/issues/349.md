## New to A11y

Emily Ladau says: [I won't pretend that disability simulation works](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/i-wont-disability-simulation_b_4936801). Emily points out that it "feels like the opposite of acceptance to have my entire identity as a person with a physical disability reduced to an isolated simulation experience." These kind of exercises may drive awareness, but ultimately don't go deep enough.
