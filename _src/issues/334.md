However, it would be a big win for the web to have a native HTML or CSS technique, no copypasta required, to visually hide elements while still exposing them to assistive technologies."

People around the world are [mourning the loss of disability rights activist Judy Heumann](https://judithheumann.com/the-world-mourns-the-passing-of-judy-heumann-disability-rights-activist/). Called the “the mother” of the disability rights movement in the United States, Heumann played a part in disability legislation, wrote a popular memior and was featured in a Netflix documentary. It's important to learn from those who have carved a path for the rest of us in the accessibility field.
