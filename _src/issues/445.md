When I first started in web accessibility and conducting audits regularly, I struggled to underatand WCAG. It's a set of standards that leave some wiggle room for interpretation. The folks at AAArdvark created a resource called [WCAG in plain english](https://aaardvarkaccessibility.com/wcag-plain-english/) that might help with this same challenge. I love the consistent structure for each standard.
