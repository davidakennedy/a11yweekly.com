## Featured: The only accessibility specialist in the room

"It's hard being the only one in your organisation or team responsible for accessibility. If that sounds familiar, I salute you, and this one's for you.

I've been thinking a lot recently about the challenges you face and some of the ways you can approach these, which I thought I'd throw into a post."

## New to A11y

Meryl Evans shares [what baking can teach us about accessibility](https://meryl.net/accessibility-beyond-compliance/). I like the analogy that Meryl makes here, saying that "Recipes and accessibility guidelines provide the minimum." Recipes don't get really good until you alter them and make them your own. Accessibility works like that too, especially at the organizational level.
