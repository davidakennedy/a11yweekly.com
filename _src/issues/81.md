## New to A11y

Scott O'Hara explains [accessible landmarks](http://www.scottohara.me/blog/2018/03/03/landmarks.html): what they are, what they do and how to use them. It's the perfect primer if you've had questions about landmarks.

## Correction

_Last week, I included a link to an article about [Leveraging machine learning in iOS for improved accessibility](https://overflow.buffer.com/2018/02/13/leveraging-machine-learning-ios-improved-accessibility/). That link was broken. Give it a visit now if you're interested._
