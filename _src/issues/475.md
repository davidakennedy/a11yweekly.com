[Disability rights activist and author Alice Wong died](https://www.npr.org/2025/11/15/nx-s1-5609903/disability-rights-activist-author-alice-wong-dies-51) last week. If you haven't heard of Alice, take come time to dig into the work they left behind. As the NPR article highlighted, "Wong was best known as the founder of the [Disability Visibility Project (DVP)](https://disabilityvisibilityproject.com/). The group highlights disabled people and disability culture through storytelling projects, social media and other channels."
