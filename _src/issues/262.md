Justine Win walks you through [testing the accessibility of your designs with a screen reader](https://ux.shopify.com/a-4-step-process-for-testing-the-accessibility-of-your-designs-17bc95bceafe), especially useful if you've never used one before. I like how Justine breaks this down into steps, backed up by well-written details. Quality can come from thorough process.
