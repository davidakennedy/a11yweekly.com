## Featured: Stop the ADA trolls

In Stop the ADA trolls, Chris Hofstader dives into the scary world of accessibility lawsuits. He says:

"Over the past month or so, I learned that there is more than one kind of web accessibility lawsuit and that NFB is not the worst offender in this space. I’ve criticized NFB on this blog and BlindConfidential before it and will continue to do so until they get technology right but, compared to the law firm, non-profit and two specific accessibility contract shops assaulting corporate America with a blitzkrieg of lawsuits in the US District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, NFB legal actions seem relatively benign."
