## New to A11y?

Michele A. Williams bookends the newsletter this week, closing it out with resources for [everyday accessibility](https://mawconsultingllc.com/2021/07/29/everyday-accessibility/). I featured Michele's work on "Everyday accessibility" in the last issue too, linking to the A11y Project article. I wanted to share this link because I love the posters! They'll remind you that accessibility happens when you put the work in little by little.
