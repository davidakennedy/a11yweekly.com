Okay, fair warning: This next link doesn't have to do with accessibility. At least not in an obvious way. In a talk called [It all means nothing in the end](https://www.youtube.com/watch?&v=Q0v2YJLq8n8), Amy Hupe discusses what do you do when you've attached your sense of self to work, and work suddenly feels meaningless. Amy explores burnout, purpose and making meaning in an increasingly confusing and calamitous world. This talk relates to accessibility because if you're in this field, you're going to hit walls and wonder why people fight so hard against something that makes complete sense ethically. And we need you to keep going.
