## Featured: Improving forms with new radios and checkboxes

Almost every designer and developer has attempted to recreate radio buttons and checkboxes in browsers for a cleaner design and better user experience. The team at Government Digital Service lays out its approach.

[U.S. Access Board updates requirements for information and communication technology](https://www.access-board.gov/news/1889-access-board-updates-requirements-for-information-and-communication-technology): This relates to the long-awaited Section 508 refresh. From the post, "The rule jointly updates and reorganizes the Section 508 standards and Section 255 guidelines in response to market trends and innovations, such as the convergence of technologies. The refresh also harmonizes these requirements with other guidelines and standards both in the U.S. and abroad, including standards issued by the European Commission and with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), a globally recognized voluntary consensus standard for web content and ICT."

## New to A11y

Bryan Garaventa has recently updated one of my favorite accessibility tools, the [Visual ARIA bookmarklet](http://whatsock.com/training/matrices/visual-aria.htm). It allows you to physically observe ARIA usage within web technologies. Read more about the [latest update](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/visual-aria-update-11-sync-bryan-garaventa) and start testing ARIA with ease.

## Suggestions and corrections

In the last issue of Accessibility Weekly, I included a link to a [resource list of accessibility lawsuits](http://karlgroves.github.io/a11y-lawsuits/lawsuits.html). It's important to note that many of the cases listed were actually resolved in structured negotiation, meaning no lawsuit was needed or filed. The list serves as a nice resource for historical context, but it doesn't tell the whole story. If you're interested in the legal side of accessibility, check out Lainey Feingold's [December, 2016 update](http://www.lflegal.com/2016/12/legal-update-december16/) on the topic.
