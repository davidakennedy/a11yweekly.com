## Featured: The politics of accessibility

"The core concept of digital accessibility is that everyone, including people with disabilities, should be able to access information and accomplish tasks via computer independently. We code for compatibility with assistive technologies and we design to reduce cognitive load and we provide transcripts and alt text and so on, all for the purpose of ensuring that any person can use their device, on their own and without assistance from us or anyone else."

Eric Eggert wrote a post about [being anti-ableist](https://yatil.net/blog/be-anti-ableist) that pairs well with the lead article from Brian DeConinck about the political nature of accessibility work.
