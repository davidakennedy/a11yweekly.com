## Featured: Evolving resources

I'm always hunting for accessibility resources, and have mentioned in this space how I keep a running list of my favorites. Well, I'm not the only one. Accessibility professional, Paul J. Adam keeps his updated constantly, and usually sends out a tweet when he changes it. It's a great page to bookmark for future reference because you just might discover a resource that could help you learn something new or reinvent your workflow.
