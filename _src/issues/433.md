## Featured: Creating accessibility systems to fix accessibility issues

"When we first start to tackle accessibility work, it usually feels very urgent. It often happens because of a lawsuit, a legal ruling, or an industry trend. Teams get served a long list of accessibility issues, with or without guidance on how to fix them. And if they do fix the issues, what happens next? Do they wait for the next audit and do it all again? This urgency tends to make accessibility work reactive instead of proactive. It’s suddenly an emergency—even if it’s actually been a problem forever. This emergency approach isn’t sustainable for anyone, including accessibility specialists, product teams, and organizations as a whole."

Louise Clark wrote a post about [considering accessibility for people with cognitive disabilities and differences](https://scribe.rip/considering-accessibility-for-people-with-cognitive-disabilities-and-differences-b208dc132a8c) that's worth a read and bookmark. Cognitive disabilities often get overlooked, especially in introductory content. I like how this framing brings in Long Covid too, since that's a recent example many people can relate to on a personal level.
