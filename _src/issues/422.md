## Featured: Designing against the deaf tax

"'Your baby has failed' isn’t a phrase any parent wants to hear. Yet for parents born with deaf children, babies are labeled failures before even leaving the hospital if they don’t pass mandated hearing tests. The weight and impact of that label is never felt by the hearing population because in an audio-dominant world, there’s no such thing as a mandatory sign language test. It’s no surprise, then, that systems fail to design for what dominant culture does not see or value: the creativity, brilliance, and depth of deaf culture."

Alistair Shepherd has published [an anti-overlay client letter](https://alistairshepherd.uk/writing/accessibility-overlays-email/) that's useful if you're getting questions about accessibility overlays. I appreciate Alistair's approach in explaining overlays in unemotional detail with justification and evidence.
