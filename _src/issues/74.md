Heydon Pickering talks about [prioritizing accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-TW_kbkzo0) and what Taylor Swift's website taught him. One of my favorite quotes: "It's certainly not more difficult to do accessibility than to learn JavaScript... The reason people find it hard and don't want to get into it so much is because they haven't prioritized it..." It's an important lesson to take with you if you're just digging into accessibility.
