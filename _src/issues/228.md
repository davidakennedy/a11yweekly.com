Veronica Lewis shares some simple [tips for optimizing a site for cognitive accessibility](https://veroniiiica.com/2021/02/18/how-i-optimize-my-website-for-cognitive-accessibility/). Lots of useful advice here. Which one can have lots of impact? Making sure links (and other labels) have descriptive names. I see a lack of this all the time in accessibility audits.
