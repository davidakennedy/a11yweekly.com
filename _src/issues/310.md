I've featured the InklusivComm site a handful of times already in the newsletter. Check it out if you haven't already. Recently, Denis Boudreau offered [five tips for a more inclusive presentations](https://inklusiv.ca/five-things-you-can-do-to-be-more-inclusive-september-2022-edition/). These kind of methods matter because so much of what we do each day comes through in talks, meetings and video recordings.
