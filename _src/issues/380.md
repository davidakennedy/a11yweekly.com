## Featured: Accessible notifications with ARIA Live Regions

"This post is a text-only excerpt from my Practical Accessibility video course. I'm making this chapter (out of 38 total) publicly available simply because I want an extensive guide to ARIA live regions to be publicly available to everyone in the community. This chapter is also one of the longest chapters in the course, and so I think it is a great preview into the level of depth that each topic is covered in the course."

Chris Ferdinandi outlines the [basic accessibility mistakes often seen in audits](https://gomakethings.com/basic-accessibility-mistakes-i-often-see-in-audits/). I enjoy seeing these type of posts because they're all a bit different and have a unique perspective.
