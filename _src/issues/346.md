## New to A11y

Slava Shestopalov has a nice post over on Smashing Magazine about [designing better links for the web](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/12/designing-better-links-websites-emails-guideline/). Links make the web, so paying extra design attention to them makes a lot of sense. I don't agree with everything in this piece, but follow its advice, and you'll make some useful links, which is what matters.
