## New to A11y

One of my favorite accessibility events, [Inclusive Design 24](https://inclusivedesign24.org/2019/), happens this week on October 10. This free, online conference wil have 24 straight hours of accessibility and inclusive design-focused talks. As usual, the schedule looks fantastic. This is a great event to tune into if you want to up your knowledge.
