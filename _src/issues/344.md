## New to A11y

Find your community. I don't think I've ever said that in this space because accessibility comes with its own community. But I encourage people new to the space to find a niche within it. [Cboard](https://www.cboard.io), an AAC web app for children and adults with speech and language impairments, aiding communication with symbols and text-to-speech, could be one such space. Recently, Cboard, which is an open source project, [received a grant from Microsoft AI for Accessibility](https://blogs.microsoft.com/accessibility/the-opportunity-for-assistive-technology/). Maybe you can make a contribution to its community or a similar one. Given my roots in content management systems, I'm also partial to the WordPress and Drupal communities. Both have strong accessibility contributors.
