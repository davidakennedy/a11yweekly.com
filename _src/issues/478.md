## Sponsored: Dark mode is now available in AAArdvark

We just launched dark mode for AAArdvark because the tools we use for testing for accessibility should be accessible too. Dark mode reduces eye strain for users with light sensitivity, helps those with certain types of visual impairments, and provides essential accommodation for people with migraine disorders or traumatic brain injuries. Your accessibility work shouldn't hurt to look at for hours. Try it out and let us know what you think.
