## Featured: Inclusive Design 24 happens September 23 2021

One of my favorite accessibility conferences happens this Thursday. Inclusive Design 24 streams online for free for 24 hours, packed with talks all about inclusive design, accessibility and more. Best of all, all the talks get recorded and posted later so you can catch up on your own time.

Get ready for [Inclusive Design 24](https://inclusivedesign24.org/2021/).

Whoa, imagine sending out 1,000 issues of a newsletter over almost two decades. That's what Laura Carlson has done with the Web Design Update newsletter [sending the 1,000th issue](https://itss.d.umn.edu/articles/webdesign-update-1000) recently. The Web Design Update always has an accessibility section full of great links, plus many other topics related the web design industry. It's one of my favorite newsletters, and you should subscribe.
