## New to A11y

Whitney Lewis put together [a beginner’s guide to manual accessibility testing](https://blog.pope.tech/2023/03/01/a-beginners-guide-to-manual-accessibility-testing/) that talks about the benefits of manual testing and more. I like the section on preparing for manual testing because many teams haven't completed accessibility testing on their products so seeing how to scope testing can be helpful.
