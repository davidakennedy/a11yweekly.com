## New to A11y?

I wanted to share a post I wrote a few weeks ago since it pairs so well with the featured article this week. [When to manage focus in an accessible way](https://adhoc.team/2021/09/09/when-to-manage-focus-in-an-accessible-way/) helps you understand focus management so someone doesn't lose their place on a page or within an experience. It's often overlooked by designers and engineers.
