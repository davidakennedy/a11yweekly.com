Adobe's Inclusive Design practice has released an [inclusive design workshop](https://github.com/adobe-inclusive-design/id-workshop) in the form of PDFs. It covers basics like disability models, the history of inclusive design and more. It's a great place to start if you're looking for material to teach and learn from.
