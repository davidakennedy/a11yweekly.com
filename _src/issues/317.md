## New to A11y?

Geri Reid gave a talk recently called [Designing an Accessible Future](https://www.gerireid.com/designing-an-accessible-future.html). In it, Geri talks through applying the principles of WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 3.0 to some current visions of the future. The talk goes in depth on both WCAG and a newer technologies, but don't let that intimidate you. The lesson for those new to accessibility is how Geri thinks through how WCAG applies to a newer technology.
