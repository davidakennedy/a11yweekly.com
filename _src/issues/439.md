## Featured: Values

"Let’s talk about the disconnect within the accessibility scene/industry/community and about the stampede of elephants in the room. Last week, Deque used their free axe-con marketing event to announce the vision of getting to 100% automated accessibility (by volume) across all disciplines within the next 10 years. This would be possible with “AI”. The backlash during the keynote was swift and forceful. I’m not sure how this was not anticipated. Axe-con is still a conference considered part of the accessibility community, so the message to replace genuine human testing and evaluation with “AI” could never land with that audience. But it also wasn’t made for that audience."

Eric Bailey gave a talk recently and wrote a related post on [harm reduction principles for digital accessibility practitioners](https://ericwbailey.website/published/harm-reduction-principles-for-digital-accessibility-practitioners/) that you should watch and read. Working in this space is hard. You'll never get it right all the time, nor be able to change it all the injustices. These principles can help evaluate a team's progress in tackling accessibility.
