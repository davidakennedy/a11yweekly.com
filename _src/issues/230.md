## New to A11y?

Jeremy Keith and the crew at Clearleft [put together a podcast episode on accessibility](https://podcast.clearleft.com/season02/episode03/) worth listening to or reading. I love the insight shared about why accessibility can be challenging: "And you get JavaScript errors if you do that wrong and you can see if your CSS is broken, but you don’t really have that with accessibility. It’s not as obvious when you’ve got something wrong." So true! But that's also what makes it fun and worthwhile to get right.
