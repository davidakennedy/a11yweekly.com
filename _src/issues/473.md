## Featured: Accessible iOS design: How Forza Football included blind users

"In my early teens, when my sight was slowly entering the low-vision territory, I loved football (soccer, if you’re American). These days, despite being blind, I still follow scores and a few leagues. My favorite iOS app for keeping up with football is Forza Football, thanks to its outstanding support for VoiceOver, Apple’s built-in screen reader for blind and low-vision users."

## Sponsored: Connect accessibility tracking to the tools your team already uses

AAArdvark’s new outgoing webhooks let you automatically create tasks, send notifications, or trigger workflows in your existing tools whenever an accessibility issue is detected. Use Zapier, Make, or custom integrations to push issues directly into Jira, Slack, Monday, Asana - whatever your team works in. No more context switching or manual updates. Your accessibility work flows naturally into your actual development process.

[Set up webhooks in your AAArdvark workspace](https://aaardvarkaccessibility.com/?utm_source=a11y-weekly&utm_medium=ads&utm_campaign=a11y-weekly-promo&utm_content=week-45).
