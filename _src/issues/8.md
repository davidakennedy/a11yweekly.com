_Hey readers! It's been almost two months since my last newsletter. I enjoyed a vacation, and a busy last two months of 2015 at conferences. This week, I've gathered a collection of news and links from the weeks I missed. Thanks for subscribing and see you on the Web in 2016!_

## How Do I Handle Alt Attributes

Alt attributes can trip up even the most seasoned web worker. But do them right, and they make a huge difference to screen reader users.

I like this table from an [article by Whitney Quesenbery](http://uxpamagazine.org/make-your-presentations-accessible/). It gives you all the basics for navigating how to handle most situations where you need an alt attribute.

If you want more explanation, check out the [W3C's alt decision tree](http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/). All images should have an alt attribute, even if it's empty or null, like: `alt=""` .
