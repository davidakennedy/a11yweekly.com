Laura Kalbag, author of the recent book, _Accessibility for Everyone_, wrote a post all about [getting started with web accessibility](http://www.creativebloq.com/advice/get-started-with-web-accessibility). She covers the core principles you should consider when creating something on the web. Give it a read if you're just digging into accessibility.
