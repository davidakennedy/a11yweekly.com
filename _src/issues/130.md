Links make the Web what it is, right? If they do, then pay attention to [better link labels](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/better-link-labels/). Great advice from this post: "Specific link text sets sincere expectations and fulfills them, and is substantial enough to stand alone while remaining succinct."
