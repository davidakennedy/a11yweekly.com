This recent post from Simon Pitt about [the death of computer files](https://onezero.medium.com/the-death-of-the-computer-file-doc-43cb028c0506) got me thinking: Are all these cloud services better for accessibility? The answer is complex, of course, but fun to think about. It's the type of question worth pondering if you're new to accessibility. I'm about to make this thing, what does that mean for all my customers?
