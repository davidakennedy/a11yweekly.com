## Featured: Accessible design is digital infrastructure

"Accessibility is where infrastructure failure shows up first. It rarely disappears through dramatic rollbacks; it erodes quietly when institutions treat it as optional instead of foundational. America by Design illustrates how removing accessibility from public platforms produces fragile infrastructure that excludes people and regresses over time."

## Sponsored: This Wednesday: Can AI build an accessible modal?

Happening: Wed, Feb 11th at 1pm PT on YouTube. Modals are notoriously tricky with focus trapping, returning focus on close, keeping background content inert, proper screen reader announcements. Even experienced developers get these wrong. So how do AI coding tools handle it? Join us for Part 2 of our "Vibe Coding Meets Accessibility" series, where we’ll put Codex, Claude Code, and Lovable to the test. We'll test everything with keyboard navigation and NVDA/Firefox. This is real-time testing so you can see exactly what each tool gets right and where it falls short.
