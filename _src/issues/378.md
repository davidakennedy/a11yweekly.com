## Featured: Level Access crosses the line; buys accessibility overlay company

"Accessibility is not a profit business. Sure, it can pay well for people who have expertise, but ultimately, it is a craft that is limited. Yes, some tooling can make aspects easier. Definitely, you can lint and autotest the hell out of your code. But eventually, the only thing that really makes your product accessible and inclusive is thinking about the inclusive experience constantly."

## New to A11y

Sophie Koonin checks out the meter element, and has some advice. [Just because you can doesn't mean you should](https://localghost.dev/blog/just-because-you-can-doesn-t-mean-you-should-the-meter-element/). I really like the guidance at the end of this post about choosing the right element semantically. It will come in handy for your accessibility work.
