Nimer Jaber writes about a [special, unadvertised feature of living with a disability](https://nimerblogs.blogspot.com/2025/08/congratulations-youve-unlocked-expert.html). What's that? "It’s the mandatory, non-optional "Expert Mode." You don’t choose it; it chooses you." Some call this the disability tax because people with disabilities have to do the extra work to make things happen. It's a good concept to understand.
