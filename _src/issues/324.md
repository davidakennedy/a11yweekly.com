## New to A11y

Joe Lamyman explores [how to create usable, consistent, and well-spaced target sizes](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2022/12/20/foundations-target-size/). Designers often overlook target sizes in their daily work because it's not a common accessibility topic. Good thing this post helps fix that. I like how Joe gives tips plus information on how to check target size.
