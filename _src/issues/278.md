## New to A11y?

The UK government created a set of [accessibility posters](https://ukhomeoffice.github.io/accessibility-posters/) covering general guidance on how to design more accessible services. The posters lay out best design practices for users from these areas: low vision, D/deaf and hard of hearing, dyslexia, motor disabilities, users on the autistic spectrum and users of screen readers. These posters are great places to start in each of these topic areas.
