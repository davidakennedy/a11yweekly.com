Sarah L. Fossheim writes about [excluding non-binary people by design with sign-up forms](https://fossheim.io/writing/posts/excluding-non-binary-people-by-design/), saying "...broken features that open the door for discriminating [against] trans and non-binary people." Unfortunately, Sarah also points out that likely either no trans or non-binary folks were involved or consulted on this, or their concerns just weren’t listened to. We have to create the time and space for good design to happen.
