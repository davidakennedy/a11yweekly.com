## Featured: Popping preconceived popover ponderings

"But I decided to finally get this post in a publishable state because I still see people asking questions about popover. Like, what is it? How does it differ from a dialog (modal or non)? Why doesn’t it do this one thing that I need it to? I’m not going to answer every question about popover. But I should get back into the habit of writing this stuff down once and pointing people to it, rather than providing repetitive one-off answers whenever I happen across someone asking about it."

## New to A11y

Laura Kalbag created a useful [accessible design checklist](https://penpot.app/blog/accessible-design-checklist/) that might come in handy if you're new to accessibility. I'm not a fan of checklists, except when you're new to an discipline or the process has a ton of details. When you're new to accessibility, you can get overwhelmed because you don't know where to start. Laura makes that easier.
