## Suggestions and corrections

**Correction**: Last week, in the New to A11y section, I included a link to [informational posters](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/) by the Government Digital Service team in the UK Government. The posters are by the Home Office Digital, a different department within the UK government.
