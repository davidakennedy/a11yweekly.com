## New to A11y

Scott Jehl has a tongue and cheek graphic posted on the topic of [the history of web performance](https://scottjehl.com/posts/the-history-of-web-performance/). The point Scott makes here is that web performance hasn't changed all that much. Scott highlights 2013 as a dividing line, which I assume is around the time JavaScript-heavy interfaces start to take shape. You always have to respect your environment.
