Carie Fisher has researched and tested how best to [handle SVGs in an accessible way](https://codepen.io/cariefisher/pen/QWpjded) for years, including articles on Deque's blog and Smashing Magazine. That knowledge also lives in this CodePen, and Carie updates it regularly. I've bookmarked this for the future, and you should too.
