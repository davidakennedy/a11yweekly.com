## New to A11y?

Michele Williams has a great talk on [conducting accessibility user research](https://technica11y.org/conducting-accessibility-user-research-what-s-reall) that you should watch. I love how Michele emphasizes this early on in the presentation: "You are responsible for testing accessibility. Your participants are testing usability." This so often gets misunderstood.
