I'm a fan of good documentation, and the Gov.uk Service Manual has a lot of it. Its [Testing with assistive technologies](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/testing-with-assistive-technologies) page covers a lot of ground with minimal content. The section on how to test with instructions, although brief, can help you get a good start on testing with assistive technology.
