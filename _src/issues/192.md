## New to A11y?

You might have joined the fight against racism recently, realizing you can do more to help. Tatiana Mac wrote a great post on [sustainable strategies for activism](https://tatianamac.com/posts/beware-of-burnout/) to help people stay with it. Many of those lessons can also be applied to activism for accessibility. We'd rather have you around well into the future too.
