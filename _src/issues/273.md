## New to A11y?

Nicolas Steenhout runs a fantastic podcast called A11y Rules about people involved in one way or another with web accessibility. The podcast also has a series you should check out called [A11y Rules Soundbites](https://a11yrules.com/series/a11y-rules-soundbite/), which are short discussions with disabled people about the barriers they encounter on the web. You get to hear what what it's like in their words. No better way to build knowledge than from people with lived experience.
