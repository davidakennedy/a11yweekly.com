Thank you for being a guest curator of Accessibility Weekly!

You’re here to help bring other voices and perspectives into the newsletter, particularly people with disabilities, others who aren’t an in an overrepresented group, or those new to the accessibility field.

A few details about being a guest curator:

- You’ll collect five links around a specific topic (not the whole newsletter). Think of them like “Deep dives” on topics like design annotations, accessibility design reviews, ARIA, etc.
- You can write a short paragraph, introducing the topic, but that’s optional.
- The guidance for most of [good links](https://a11yweekly.com/good-links/) apply to the ones selected by the guest curator.
- You don’t have to stick to the topic in a strict sense. Throw a surprise or two in there, trying to find a piece or two that’s loosely related, and has the potential to teach people about accessibility without being about accessibility.
- The links don’t have to be current within two months, but you should aim for them to be timeless. The takeaways should be relevant for those working in web and/or mobile accessibility today.

If you have any questions, reach out at <hello@a11yweekly.com>.
