## About

This newsletter started because I believe you make the web accessible. Anyone who works on the web can make that happen one change at a time. To make that happen, you have to learn a bit each week.

<p class="callout">If you enjoy the newsletter, consider <a href="https://paypal.me/davidakennedy">making a small donation</a>.</p>
